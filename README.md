Survival analysis is a set of statistical approaches used to find out the time it takes for an event of interest to occur. 

Survival analysis is used to study the time until some event of interest (often referred to as death) occurs. 

Time could be measured in years, months, weeks, days, etc. In cancer studies, 


**Most of the survival analyses use the following methods.** 

      (1) Kaplan-Meier plots to visualize survival curves. 

      (2) Nelson-Aalen plots to visualize the cumulative hazard. 

      (3) Log-rank test to compare the survival curves of two or more groups 

      (4) Cox proportional hazards regression to find out the effect of different variables like age, sex, race on survival.
